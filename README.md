DATA STRUCTURE
The dataset contains the enrolled students over several years, including their personal details, Course, Enrollment Date, and Total Payment made for the course, some issues were identified during the data quality check which included missing data entries, inconsistency in data entry method, and some duplicated records. In the absence of additional data, certain columns, like age, were imputed with mean values, while others, such as course, were marked as “Not Available” to ensure precise enrollment figures. Entries with insufficient information, such as incomplete names, were deleted.
The yearly revenue was generated for each year by multiplying the number of course Enrollment in each year with the Total Payment made.
